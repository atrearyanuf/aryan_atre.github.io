## 🧠 What Drives Me

Whether it's deploying a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline, optimizing NLP search using **LLMs and OCR**, or building real-time media AI systems, my work is driven by one mission: **turning raw data into meaningful action**.

With projects and internships across **consulting**, **finance**, and **media-tech**, I bring a diverse problem-solving toolkit that spans:

- **Deep Learning** (ResNet-50, LSTMs, Transformers)  
- **MLOps & Deployment** (Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana)  
- **Cloud Platforms** (AWS, Azure)  
- **Data Strategy** (User behavior modeling, A/B testing, Forecasting)  
- **Tools**: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, SQL, Pinecone, OpenAI API, Flask, LangChain, etc.
