# Bridging Data, Intelligence & Impact 🚀

Hi, I’m **Aryan Atre** — a technologist and strategist-in-the-making, currently pursuing my **Master’s in Artificial Intelligence Systems** at the **University of Florida**, and building smart, scalable solutions where **machine learning meets business strategy**.

Whether it’s aligning algorithms with insights at **WPP**, shaping financial intelligence at **EY**, or deploying real-time media AI at **Neural Garage**, I bring a systems-thinking mindset and hands-on engineering skills to every project I touch.

## 💼 Current Role: Data Strategy & Machine Learning Intern @ WPP

At **WPP New York**, I work at the intersection of ML, data, and business. From analyzing user behavior to modeling $6B+ client decisions, I help global brands unlock value with algorithms — blending neural networks, clustering, and visual storytelling to turn messy data into actionable strategy.

This experience has deepened my passion for consulting, where data doesn’t just explain — it **influences**, **guides**, and **transforms**.

## 🧠 What I Love Building

I believe in the power of AI **beyond the model** — where intelligence systems are usable, explainable, and impactful. My interests lie in:

- **AI for Decision-Making** — ML models that inform real-world choices  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** — Combining LLMs with smart indexing  
- **NLP + Finance** — Search optimization, OCR, and compliance automation  
- **AI in Media** — Real-time lip-sync, object detection, deep visual models  
- **MLOps** — Building robust, production-ready pipelines
